                        I had a dream I seen my name on the gravel stone
                        And read here lies a G followed by a poem
                        I couldn 't see the words but I'
                        m sure what 's in his own
                        Funny that I write most when I know my feeling 's wrong
                        With both shoulders that my head is always on
                        I trudge through harm 's way with heavy boulders on my arm
                        I feel strong as I walk through the many storms that
                        Rain on my parade, seen the dust cry
                        for days
                        I 'm feeling like a young prince, I'
                        m drinking today
                        My name ring bells all the way to heaven 's gate
                        Though STEEZy told about me, yo I know he always watching
                        I guess there really is a heaven
                        for us hip hoppers
                        I really miss my partner
                        But I know he with Big Poppa, 2 Pacs, and the big L rolled proper
                        And that 's a big pun, know that I'
                        mma join him
                        When my time come, but the story just begun, so

                        My clouds grey, I hope my pain don’ t show
                        Looking in the sky I wonder where them rainbows go
                        They say that
                        if we reign, them pot - of - gold’ s will show
                        Even skating down the block don’ t feel the same no more
                        If I ain’ t looking, I still see it all
                        My vision’ s jaded, too much bitches rubbed the crystal balls
                        They stay scheming, y’ all like the sheep to the shepherd
                        The trees to the leaves, you needed but not needed
                        So I work alone, lone wolf, stay creeping
                        I 'd rather hunt on my own then be owned and not eating
                        I’ m not eatin’, not blamin’, I’ m just sayin’
                        Go to bed with hunger pains
                        while these other niggas caking, they too fake
                        No rappers rapping
                        for years waiting 'round for that big break
                        Break a arm,
                        break a bond before I go
                        break the bank
                        Break a hundred, that 's fifty-fifty
                        Long as[ ? ] and Whitney 's seen different cities, different titties
                        I bring no money with me, I 'm on my grind man, no regrets when I die man
                        'Til we fly man, '
                        til we fly man, 'til we fly man
                        You gon ' miss us when we fly man",
